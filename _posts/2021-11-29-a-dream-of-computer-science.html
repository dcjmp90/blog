<p>Life altering decisions are never easy, nor will those changes happen within the most optimal timeline for you. Of course you want the change, who wouldn’t want better? It sounds amazing in theory, but the reality of it is a tough pill to swallow. This is my journey.</p>

<p>As a high school student with very little direction, I didn’t contribute much to my early years of education and career. I worked at Dairy Queen, played hacky sack at lunch, and ditched classes after lunch for fast-food and video games. Needless to say, Yale wasn’t going to be knocking on my door. At that time, I was struggling to maintain a 2.0 grade point average, which included a failing grade in your run-of-the-mill high school algebra.</p>

<p>And there will be little shock and awe to my next step in life: The United States Air Force.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Spark that Lit the Flame</h2>

<p>Whether we see it or not, we all come to a fork in the road countless times throughout life. At some point I found myself armed to the teeth at some munitions depot in the middle of South Korea for a 12 hour night shift. I was alone all night with my thoughts. What am I doing with my life...How did I get here...Is this it? Many questions and thoughts began to overwhelm me. </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I knew I wanted to do something more with my life.</p>

<p>Naturally, I gravitated towards computers and tech from all my time building computers and playing video games. Computer Science was the most common theme from a ton of Google searching. I need to figure out this math thing if I want to succeed. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">This is Where the Fun Begins…</h2>

<p>I enrolled into college at <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/">University of Texas at San Antonio</a>...randomly. I had no reason for this specific school, but it was as good of a place as any in my opinion. </p>

<p>Working and full-time college would be a death sentence. I figured out that I could live on some grant funds as well as my military benefits if I had roommates in student housing, but I would need to get rid of nearly all of my possessions. I am now living with a gym bag, suitcase worth of clothes, a really good laptop, and no transportation of any kind.</p>

<p>After 4 remedial math courses, I finally got through college algebra and started my path towards Calculus! Now I can get to my actual degree. The only problem is that I’m on a real time clock here.</p>

<p>And my benefits are not a specific amount, rather a specific time allotment. It is very strange when you take it out of context, but that means they cover X amount of time no matter the cost per semester. I decided to take 5 courses each semester to get the most value from my benefits without failing my courses. I was in and committed. </p>

<p>I eventually navigated my first <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%201083">Programming 1</a> course, which gave me the programming bug...I was reinvigorated and hungry for more! Each course got harder and harder to the point I spent every day of my Spring breaks and weekends in the computer lab working. This isn’t the mindset or the necessary devotion one requires to successfully complete this degree, but I think it’s needed if you wish to truly learn the ins and outs of the topics covered. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Is CS Hard? Yes and No</h2>

<p>I am not and will never imply that Computer Science majors are “elite” or some other bogus claim. Yes, we do have our “elitist” just like any other major, but that really says more about the individual and less about the major. These courses and how they must be taught are really different from your traditional college course. After my civics and other general courses, I never saw things like McGraw Hill, textbooks, or even scantrons for the remainder of my degree. </p>

<p>The real strangeness to this degree will be that the tests will still be conducted with paper and pencil, while the entirety of the course outside of tests is all computers and coding within an integrated development environment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a>). That’s a huge disconnect for me, but it’s a perfect preparation for interviewing as a Software Engineer. Let’s not open that can of worms just yet. </p>

<p>Each course I had roughly one programming assignment due every week, which is multiplied by how many courses I’m taking, and I am also learning the language or principles being taught. This isn’t it. There will be a midterm, final exam, personal/group project, and potential for quizzes on top for each and every class. To give you an idea of complexity, we had a first programming assignment assigning some data into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a> in early course levels, and we would have to create our own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage collector</a> in C for a first assignment in later courses.</p>

<p>I think this program will become hard if you don’t continually try to develop your skills and understanding by diving deeper into the coursework. I unintentionally took this route and it paid dividends. It’s important, in my opinion, to ask the why about anything you’re doing. I would also attribute my continued growth to the types of people I surrounded myself with. I chose to study with the best of the best in my degree program. Not to be lazy and have them take up the slack, but to push each other further and find new limits.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Semester that Would Change Everything</h2>

<p>My Junior year of Computer Science started Fall 2018 with a seriously overwhelming amount of programming courses: <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%203753">Data Science</a>, <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%203443">Application Programming</a>, <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%203424">Systems Programming</a>, <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%203343">Analysis of Algorithms</a>, and <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%203873">Computer Networks</a>. Now you might be able to see where all those assignments will start demoralizing you. The programming languages I was using and/or learning during this semester: Python, Perl, Java, C, AWK, and Bash. Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds. </p>

<p>But this grueling semester leads me towards my introduction into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a>. My Application Programming Professor, <a href="https://cs.utsa.edu/people/faculty/fernandez-amanda-141">Dr. Amanda Fernandez</a>, left me curious about her field of research. It was day 1 of the course, and she gave a brief bio about herself and her research. More specifically, she was touching on her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> research. Man, that is (and still is) the coolest topic to me.</p>

<p>This curiosity led me to several office hour visits to ask about research and the field she was in. I couldn’t get enough. She would probably say otherwise (joking). It seemed so advanced and unattainable, but I wanted to learn more and get into it. I started with Independent Study and Artificial Intelligence courses taught by Dr. Amanda Fernandez. I started with Natural Language Processing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>) and doing some things like sentiment analysis and building chatbots. To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing, but I was learning small pieces of larger pie while I fell in the right direction. That’s basically our everyday life right? Controlled falls in the right direction. I didn’t fully grasp everything I was doing until I took an advanced topics course of hers called <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%204263">Deep Learning</a>.</p>

<p>My first true taste of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer Vision</a> was in this <a href="https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%204263">Deep Learning</a> course, and it was actually impressive how powerful it could be. My project in that course was a generative adversarial network (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GAN</a>) that would produce altered images of a provided profile picture. Change their hair, eyes, mouth, etc. This was one of my final and favorite courses I completed in my undergraduate degree. If you ever read this Professor Clark, your course is also one of my favorites! Data Structures with you is a course I will never forget. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Failed Startup == Personal Growth?</h2>

<p>I graduated. One of my colleagues at the time offered me a referral to a start-up company, which I thought was doing me a favor. I took the job to start as a Machine Learning Engineer. This startup had no leadership or engineering to support any type of Machine Learning platform. I was duped. My “friend” left that company shortly after I joined. Fast forward 6 months, I left that company. </p>

<p>During this time I still kept in contact with Dr. Fernandez, and I reached out to her about my new status of unemployed. We discussed the alternative of graduate school. I had no idea what to research or do in graduate school, but I knew I wanted to keep pursuing Artificial Intelligence. We found a <a href="https://research.fb.com/programs/openeds-challenge/">workshop by Facebook</a> on a Computer Vision problem I can work on. I ended up publishing 3 months later and flying to South Korea to present my research in an oral presentation at the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/OpenEDS/Perry_MinENet_A_Dilated_CNN_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Eye_Features_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf">International Conference on Computer Vision</a>. Looks like I found my research topic!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Pick It Up & Run With It!</h2>

<p>This passion for Computer Vision and the problem space of Semantic Segmentation led me through graduate school. I published once more at the <a href="https://openeyes-workshop.github.io/downloads/openeyes2020_jonathan_perry_eyeseg_fast_and_efficient_few_shot_semantic_segmentation.pdf">European Conference on Computer Vision</a> and I successfully defended my Master Thesis on this research topic. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Oral Presentation at an AI Summit shortly after my return from ICCV2019 in South Korea.</span>

<p>Dr. Fernandez’s research lab, Vision and Aritificial Intelligence Laboratory (<a href="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~fernandez/vail.html">VAIL</a>), acted as an incubator for me in many ways. Letting passion drive my learning and growth was the best decision I have ever made. I wouldn’t know where I would be today without my friendships and mentorships developed through research at VAIL. If any of you VAIL members read this, I miss you all and I truly want to thank you for everything!</p>

<p>This all led me to now. I am working my dream job as a Machine Learning Engineer and I AM LOVING IT! </p>
