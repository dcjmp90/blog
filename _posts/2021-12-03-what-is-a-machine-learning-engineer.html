<p>There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the technology industry has been moving faster than ever. No one has anticipated the growth that there is now. If you find someone that says otherwise, please ask them if we can borrow their crystal ball. </p>

<p>In the midst of all these technological advances, new job opportunities and new industry needs arise. I think we have all been gradually getting comfortable with the buzzwords: Data Science, Big Data, Cloud whatever. You might be seeing another job starting to circulate more and more through each hiring iteration and joining the ranks of top careers of our time: Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). What in the world is that? </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Who You Are.</h2>

<p>This is probably a highly debatable topic, but I’ll give you what an “ideal” candidate would be for mostly any tech company. Your most common discipline you will see cropping up time and time again will be Computer Science. It is my discipline, and I would say that it sets you up for success in this field. However, this isn’t the only path one can take to achieve a career path as an MLE. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">These are all the types of Master's degrees held by MLE's in my lab.</span>

<p>Realistically, you will need some type of established background with Software Engineering and Machine Learning to be suitable for this job. I think there are a ton of ways to obtain those skills, and my current team in our lab easily shows that. I think this is actually a strength that our lab has. Diversity is never a bad thing – true for all but specifically talking about academic background diversity. Machine Learning is a multi-faceted problem and anyone can bring value in that regard. But you better know some ML and have some coding abilities! </p>
