<p>There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the technology industry has been moving faster than ever. No one has anticipated the growth that there is now. If you find someone that says otherwise, please ask them if we can borrow their crystal ball. </p>

You might be seeing another job starting to circulate more and more through each hiring iteration and joining the ranks of top careers of our time: Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). What in the world is that? </p>
