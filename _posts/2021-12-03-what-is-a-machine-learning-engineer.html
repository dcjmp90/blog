<p>There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the technology industry has been moving faster than ever. No one has anticipated the growth that there is now. If you find someone that says otherwise, please ask them if we can borrow their crystal ball. </p>

<p>In the midst of all these technological advances, new job opportunities and new industry needs arise. I think we have all been gradually getting comfortable with the buzzwords: Data Science, Big Data, Cloud whatever. You might be seeing another job starting to circulate more and more through each hiring iteration and joining the ranks of top careers of our time: Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). What in the world is that? </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Your Background.</h2>

<p>This is probably a highly debatable topic. Your most common discipline you will see cropping up time and time again will be Computer Science. It is my discipline, and I would say that it sets you up for success in this field. However, this isn’t the only path one can take to achieve a successful career as an MLE. No fancy buzzwords or specific tools. I will not be imploring you to learn  ____ programming language. Those will change over time; they always do. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">These are all the types of Master's degrees held by MLE's in my lab.</span>

<p>Realistically, you will need some type of established background with Software Engineering and Machine Learning to be suitable for this job. I think there are a ton of ways to obtain those skills, and my current lab easily shows that. I think this is actually a strength that our lab has. Diversity is never a bad thing – true for all but specifically talking about academic background diversity. Machine Learning is a multi-faceted problem and anyone can bring value in that regard. But you better know some ML and have some coding abilities! </p>

<p>It’s important to know the skill set and competencies that allows me to produce and deliver. While I may cover some of that in the next section, I will mention upfront that this isn’t a role where you will be tasked with clear objectives all the time. It isn’t something that always has answers or well-defined procedures for every scope of problem. </p>

<p>I Google searched this question myself “What an MLE Does” as I was writing this. It’s not that I don’t know what I do, but this is actually a lot harder to put into general terms that everyone can understand. There is a TON of misinformation about this field, and a lot of people giving "insights" that are not MLE’s or they are simply translating job postings from recruiters that are also not in this field. I will do my best to be transparent. </p>
