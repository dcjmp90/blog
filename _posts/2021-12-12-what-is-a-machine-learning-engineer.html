<p>There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the technology industry has been moving faster than ever. No one has anticipated the growth that there is now. If you find someone that says otherwise, please ask them if we can borrow their crystal ball. </p>

<p>In the midst of all these technological advances, new job opportunities and new industry needs arise. I think we have all been gradually getting comfortable with the buzzwords: Data Science, Big Data, Cloud whatever. You might be seeing another job starting to circulate more and more through each hiring iteration and joining the ranks of top careers of our time: Machine Learning Engineer (MLE). What in the world is that? </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Your Background.</h2>

<p>This is probably a highly debatable topic. Your most common discipline you will see cropping up time and time again will be Computer Science. It is my discipline, and I would say that it sets you up for success in this field. However, this isn’t the only path one can take to achieve a successful career as an MLE. No fancy buzzwords or specific tools. I will not be imploring you to learn  ____ programming language. Those will change over time; they always do. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">These are all the types of Master's degrees held by MLE's in my lab.</span>

<p>Realistically, you will need some type of established background with Software Engineering and Machine Learning to be suitable for this job. I think there are a ton of ways to obtain those skills, and my current lab easily shows that. I think this is actually a strength that our lab has. Diversity is never a bad thing – true for all but specifically talking about academic background diversity. Machine Learning is a multi-faceted problem and anyone can bring value in that regard. But you better know some ML and have some coding abilities! </p>

<p>It’s important to know the skill set and competencies that allows me to produce and deliver. While I may cover some of that in the next section, I will mention upfront that this isn’t a role where you will be tasked with clear objectives all the time. It isn’t something that always has answers or well-defined procedures for every scope of problem. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What Do You Do?</h2>

<p>I Google searched this question myself “What an MLE Does” as I was writing this. It’s not that I don’t know what I do, but this is actually a lot harder to put into general terms that everyone can understand. There is a TON of misinformation about this field, and a lot of people giving advice that are not MLE’s or they are simply translating job postings from recruiters that are also not in this field. I will do my best to be transparent, but I do want to keep things abstract. I will have other posts on specifics regarding my previous roles.</p>

<p>Easy. You build cool things. Next question! There’s actually more merit in that statement than I would like there to be. We research problems, and sometimes we find ways to repurpose, reengineer, or translate a solution from something else to ours, however it is on a more frequent basis where we find ourselves on the tip of the spear developing novel solutions. This is where some people may disagree with me. To those readers, what I am saying is true, but there are other roles that may be primary and MLE’s are secondary on this at your company. It really depends where in the company you are working. If you want more exposure to this portion, then I suggest you work in a labs division or research and development branch of the company. Other branches and divisions will probably be provided with a solution and solely build the pipeline for it.</p>

<p>The solutions we are developing are typically Machine Learning algorithms that will be deployed into an application or infrastructure that will be served to users. Users will typically indirectly interact with these ML algorithms you developed through this workflow, usually called an ML pipeline, which is something you and some software engineers with other specializations will create. These ML pipelines will be automated and that means there will be zero direct human assistance or intervention within that user's interaction with your live product.</p>

<p>Think of your smartphone. It probably has a voice assistant currently supported on it, right?  
    Well, I can tell you there are quite a few Machine Learning Engineers that worked on that virtual assistant. At the very beginning, that assistant needs to take your voice and translate it to text before it can understand what you are saying. This alone is an ML model that will require an ML pipeline. There will be a team of MLE’s for this. They had to develop that ML solution and build the workflow to capture your voice and feed a formatted input into their ML algorithm. We obviously know the desired output will be exactly what you said in text format, and this would be fed to the next ML model to the next and to the next and so on. You may not have realized this, but there are probably 10’s to 100’s of Machine Learning models that make up the pipeline for your voice to intelligent response(s) being displayed or said back to you.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">...So..What is a Machine Learning Engineer?</h2>

<p>We are Software Engineers with a strong background and specialization into Machine Learning. We are researching data and ML algorithms, implementing or creating novel ML algorithms, and designing ML systems and pipelines. We are the meat and potatoes of that virtual assistant or any other intelligent system. To list some other areas off the top of my head: streaming service recommendation systems, self-driving cars, face recognition, bank fraud detection, better graphics from your game (super sampling), airport security, agriculture, food services, cleaning services, and even applications within the medical field. Machine Learning plays a key role in every one of these areas. You can safely assume that every single industry will have MLE’s at work.  </p>
