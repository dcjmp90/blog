        <p>Life altering decisions are never easy, nor will those changes happen within the most optimal timeline for you. Of course you want the change, who wouldn’t want better? It sounds amazing in theory, but the reality of it is a tough pill to swallow. This is my journey.</p>

<p>As a high school student with very little direction, I didn’t contribute much to my early years of education and career. I worked at Dairy Queen, played hacky sack at lunch, and ditched classes after lunch for fast-food and video games. Needless to say, Yale wasn’t going to be knocking on my door. At that time, I was struggling to maintain a 2.0 grade point average, which included a failing grade in your run-of-the-mill high school algebra.</p>

<p>And there will be little shock and awe to my next step in life: The United States Air Force.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Spark that Lit the Flame</h2>

<p>Whether we see it or not, we all come to a fork in the road countless times throughout life. At some point I found myself armed to the teeth at some munitions depot in the middle of South Korea for a 12 hour night shift. I was alone all night with my thoughts. What am I doing with my life...How did I get here...Is this it? Many questions and thoughts began to overwhelm me. </p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work</blockquote>

<p>I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I knew I wanted to do something more with my life.</p>

<p>Naturally, I gravitated towards computers and tech from all my time building computers and playing video games. Computer Science was the most common theme from a ton of Google searching. I need to figure out this math thing if I want to succeed. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">This is Where the Fun Begins…</h2>

<p>I enrolled into college at <a href="https://www.utsa.edu/">University of Texas at San Antonio</a>...randomly. I had no reason for this specific school, but it was as good of a place as any in my opinion. </p>

<p>Working and full-time college would be a death sentence. I figured out that I could live on some grant funds as well as my military benefits if I had roommates in student housing, but I would need to get rid of nearly all of my possessions. I am now living with a gym bag, suitcase worth of clothes, a really good laptop, and no transportation of any kind.</p>

<p>After 4 remedial math courses, I finally got through college algebra and started my path towards Calculus! 5 courses each semester to get the most value from my benefits. I was in and committed. </p>

<p>Eventually I finally took my first Programming I course, which gave me the programming bug...I was reinvigorated and hungry for more! Each course got harder and harder to the point I spent every day of my Spring breaks in the computer lab working.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Semester that Would Change Everything</h2>

<p>My Junior year of Computer Science started Fall 2018 with a seriously overwhelming amount of programming courses: Data Science, Application Programming, Systems Programming, Analysis of Algorithms, and Computer Networks. Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds. </p>

<p>My introduction to Artificial Intelligence started with the introduction of my Application Programming Professor, Dr. Amanda Fernandez, which left me curious about her field of research. </p>

<p>This curiosity led me to several office hour visits to ask about research and the field she was in. I couldn’t get enough. It seemed so advanced and seemingly unattainable, but I wanted to learn more and get into it. I started with Independent Study and Artificial Intelligence courses taught by Dr. Amanda Fernandez.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Failed Startup == Personal Growth?</h2>

<p>I graduated. One of my colleagues at the time offered me a referral to a start-up company, which I thought was doing me a favor. I took the job to start as a Machine Learning Engineer. This startup had no leadership or engineering to support any type of Machine Learning platform. I was duped. My “friend” left that company shortly after I joined. Fast forward 6 months, I left that company. </p>

<p>During this time I still kept in contact with Dr. Fernandez, and I reached out to her about my new status of unemployed. We discussed the alternative of graduate school. I had no idea what to research or do in graduate school, but I knew I wanted to keep pursuing Artificial Intelligence. We found a <a href="https://research.fb.com/programs/openeds-challenge/">workshop by Facebook</a> on a Computer Vision problem I can work on. I ended up publishing 3 months later and flying to South Korea to present my research in an oral presentation at the <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCVW_2019/papers/OpenEDS/Perry_MinENet_A_Dilated_CNN_for_Semantic_Segmentation_of_Eye_Features_ICCVW_2019_paper.pdf">International Conference on Computer Vision</a>. Looks like I found my research topic!</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Find Your Passion, Let It Guide You!</h2>

<p>This passion for Computer Vision and the problem space of Semantic Segmentation led me through graduate school. I published once more at the <a href="https://openeyes-workshop.github.io/downloads/openeyes2020_jonathan_perry_eyeseg_fast_and_efficient_few_shot_semantic_segmentation.pdf">European Conference on Computer Vision</a> and I successfully defended my Master Thesis on this research topic. </p>

<span class="caption text-muted">Oral Presentation at an AI Summit shortly after my return from ICCV2019 in South Korea.</span>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~fernandez/vail.html">Dr. Fernandez’s research lab</a> acted as an incubator for me. Letting passion drive my learning and growth was the best decision I have ever made. I am now working my dream job as a Machine Learning Engineer and I AM LOVING IT! </p>

<p>Don’t forget two of the key takeaways I implied here:<br/><ul> <li></li><span>Get out of your comfort zone</span></li><li><span>create your network; show your value and worth!</span> </li></ul></p>
