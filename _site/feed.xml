Of course you want the change, who wouldn’t want better? It sounds amazing in theory, but the reality of it is a tough pill to swallow. This is my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a high school student with very little direction, I didn’t contribute much to my early years of education and career. I worked at Dairy Queen, played hacky sack at lunch, and ditched classes after lunch for fast-food and video games. Needless to say, Yale wasn’t going to be knocking on my door. At that time, I was struggling to maintain a 2.0 grade point average, which included a failing grade in your run-of-the-mill high school algebra.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there will be little shock and awe to my next step in life: The United States Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Spark that Lit the Flame&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether we see it or not, we all come to a fork in the road countless times throughout life. At some point I found myself armed to the teeth at some munitions depot in the middle of South Korea for a 12 hour night shift. I was alone all night with my thoughts. What am I doing with my life...How did I get here...Is this it? Many questions and thoughts began to overwhelm me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;At some point, everything's gonna go south on you and you're going to say, this is it. This is how I end. Now you can either accept that, or you can get to work&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what I was going to do, but I knew I wanted to do something more with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I gravitated towards computers and tech from all my time building computers and playing video games. Computer Science was the most common theme from a ton of Google searching. I need to figure out this math thing if I want to succeed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;This is Where the Fun Begins…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enrolled into college at University of Texas at San Antonio...randomly. I had no reason for this specific school, but it was as good of a place as any in my opinion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working and full-time college would be a death sentence. I figured out that I could live on some grant funds as well as my military benefits if I had roommates in student housing, but I would need to get rid of nearly all of my possessions. I am now living with a gym bag, suitcase worth of clothes, a really good laptop, and no transportation of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 4 remedial math courses, I finally got through college algebra and started my path towards Calculus! 5 courses each semester to get the most value from my benefits. I was in and committed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I finally took my first Programming I course, which gave me the programming bug...I was reinvigorated and hungry for more! Each course got harder and harder to the point I spent every day of my Spring breaks in the computer lab working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Semester that Would Change Everything&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Junior year of Computer Science started Fall 2018 with a seriously overwhelming amount of programming courses: Data Science, Application Programming, Systems Programming, Analysis of Algorithms, and Computer Networks. Yes, it’s as bad as it sounds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My introduction to Artificial Intelligence started with the introduction of my Application Programming Professor, Dr. Amanda Fernandez, which left me curious about her field of research. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This curiosity led me to several office hour visits to ask about research and the field she was in. I couldn’t get enough. It seemed so advanced and seemingly unattainable, but I wanted to learn more and get into it. I started with Independent Study and Artificial Intelligence courses taught by Dr. Amanda Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Failed Startup == Personal Growth?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated. One of my colleagues at the time offered me a referral to a start-up company, which I thought was doing me a favor. I took the job to start as a Machine Learning Engineer. This startup had no leadership or engineering to support any type of Machine Learning platform. I was duped. My “friend” left that company shortly after I joined. Fast forward 6 months, I left that company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this time I still kept in contact with Dr. Fernandez, and I reached out to her about my new status of unemployed. We discussed the alternative of graduate school. I had no idea what to research or do in graduate school, but I knew I wanted to keep pursuing Artificial Intelligence. We found a workshop by Facebook on a Computer Vision problem I can work on. I ended up publishing 3 months later and flying to South Korea to present my research in an oral presentation at the International Conference on Computer Vision. Looks like I found my research topic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Find Your Passion, Let It Guide You!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This passion for Computer Vision and the problem space of Semantic Segmentation led me through graduate school. I published once more at the European Conference on Computer Vision and I successfully defended my Master Thesis on this research topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/bzksjjy/img-20191111-161950.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;MinENet Oral Presentation&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;Oral Presentation at an AI Summit shortly after my return from ICCV2019 in South Korea.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Fernandez’s research lab acted as an incubator for me. Letting passion drive my learning and growth was the best decision I have ever made. I am now working my dream job as a Machine Learning Engineer and I AM LOVING IT! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t forget two of the key takeaways I implied here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Get out of your comfort zone&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create your professional network by showing interest (show your value and worth).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jon Perry</name></author><summary type="html">Life altering decisions are never easy, nor will those changes happen within the most optimal timeline for you.
